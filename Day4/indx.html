                <p class="align">Our beloved Charlie is the ultimate comedian in our family! With his goofy smiles 😄 and that endlessly wagging tail 🐾 (which doubles as a duster), he fills our home with laughter. He loves carrying random things around—shoes, remotes, you name it—and calls it "helping" 🐶😂. A true water lover, Charlie never misses a chance to splash into a puddle or pool 💦. He’s also our "lean-on-me" buddy, always leaning in for cuddles. Whether greeting strangers with boundless enthusiasm or joining our conversations with funny grumbles, Charlie’s charm is unmatched. And yes, he’s convinced he’s a lap dog, making cuddle time hilariously awkward yet oh-so-sweet ❤️🐕!</p>

                <p class="align">Charlie is the heart of our family🐾✨. He has a knack for stealing snacks with ninja-like precision 🍗😅. His love for water is unmatched—whether it’s a puddle, a pool, or even the garden hose, Charlie’s ready to dive in 💦🐕. He also insists on being part of every family activity🎾😂. His "helpfulness" extends to carrying random items like socks or slippers, which he parades around proudly 🧦🐾. Charlie is the ultimate cuddle bug🛋️❤️. He loves to "talk" with his funny grumbles and howls, as if he’s sharing his thoughts on the latest family gossip 🐶🗣️. His greetings are legendary, treating every visitor as if they’re his long-lost best friend 🏡✨. With Charlie around, there’s never a dull moment, and our hearts are always full of love and laughter ❤️🐕. We’re so lucky to have our goofy, loving companion by our side! 🐾🎉</p>
